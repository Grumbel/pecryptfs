pecryptfs - Portable Userspace eCryptfs
=======================================

pecryptfs is a simple and somewhat incomplete Python implementation of
the eCryptfs encryption and allows to decrypt encrypted files from a
eCryptfs filesystem in userspace. Passphrase based file and filename
encryption are supported, while public key encryption is not supported
at the moment.
